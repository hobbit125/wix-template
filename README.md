wix-template
============

This is an example template for a wix installer project that includes an exe, an images folder and a docs folder.

Pre-build powershell scripts that use heat are included to generate components for the images and docs folders.

This template assumes that you are using Wix 3.7 and that wix is installed in the default path of
C:\Program Files (x86)\WiX Toolset v3.7

If you have installed wix to a different location, you will need to update the wixproj file and the ps1 files
in the scripts directory to reflect this.
